Built using the **Django** framework, this website hosts an online game where players can patrol the moon Callisto with remote controlled mechanical suits custom equipped with armor and weapons which persist between login sessions.

#### Features
This project uses **sass** to create the **UI/UX** along with a simple front-end **JavaScript** framework which retrieves **JSON** data from a custom **web API** to **manipulate the DOM**.

Automated tests were designed using **Django's** built-in **testing** framework to verify critical functionality related to the design of the game mechanics and **unit testing**.

On the back-end, an **ORM** is used to persist data to a file based database, while authentication is handled by **Django's** built-in authentication tools and endpoints.
