Web game written in Python and JavaScript utilizing Django and the Fetch API

This project is a web based text based adventure game written using the Django web framework. It utilizes many of Django's built in classes and functions to create a fully functional dynamic website with data persistence, user authentication, views and many other features. It also utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve JSON resources from the server which are then decoded and used to manipulate the DOM.
